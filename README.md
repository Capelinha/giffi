## Requirements
Preferably using Windows 10, no builds for linux and mac for now.

Installing ffmpeg or the program won't work, I'm out of time so feel free to include it in the project if you want, but for now ffmpeg needs to be installed separately.

[How to Install FFmpeg](https://windowsloop.com/install-ffmpeg-windows-10/)

## Setup

1° Download the latest version installer from the release section of Github.

2° Run the installer.

3° Enjoy it.

## How to use

1° Open the program.

2° Resize the window until it covers the area to be recorded in the gray dotted part of the program.

3° Click on the "Video" or "Gif" button.

4° When you want to end the recording, just click the program on the windows taskbar.

5° Select the save location for the file.

## Disclaimers

If you have more than one screen, you may need to change the screen on the button with the screen icon to be able to record on non-primary screens.
